        <b>Karma</b> represents tens of thousands of UK vehicle owners on a no-win
        no-fee basis against many of the leading vehicle manufacturers. This
        follows allegations that manufacturers fitted 'defeat' devices to their
        diesel vehicles to cheat the EU and UK emissions laws. Leigh Day is
        acting on behalf of these owners, and is claiming compensation worth
        thousands of pounds per vehicle.
